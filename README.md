# Tron Volume Bot

This is a **Tron volume bot** designed to automate trades on the Tron blockchain, leveraging **Jupiter** and **Jito bundle** for optimized transactions. 

## Setup Instructions

1. **Create a virtual environment**  
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment**  
   - For Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - For Windows:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
     ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the bot**  
   ```bash
   python solid_trex.py
   ```

### TronGrid API Key

To run this bot on the **mainnet**, you will need an API key from [TronGrid.io](https://www.trongrid.io/).  
You can run the bot on the testnet (demo mode) without an API key.

## Additional Functionality: TRX Sender

Inside this folder, there is a file called `trx_sender.py`, which allows you to send all TRX from multiple wallets to a specific address.  
To use it, run the following command:

```bash
python trx_sender.py
```

### Steps:
- Input the **main address** where you want to send the TRX.
- Enter the **name of the wallet file** (e.g., `wallets1.txt`).  
  This file should contain the wallet addresses you want to transfer the TRX from.

The bot will then transfer the TRX from all the wallets listed in the file to your specified main address.

## Important Notes

- Enter a **minimum delay of 10 seconds** between trades to avoid errors.
- Be cautious when setting the `min_trade_amount` and `max_trade_amount` to prevent execution errors. Always refer to the minimum trade requirements of the exchanges.
- **Testnet mode** is highly recommended before running the bot on the mainnet to ensure correct functionality.

## Disclaimer

⚠️ **Warning**: You are solely responsible for any loss of capital when using this bot. Please use it at your own risk.
